# printvault

A powerful tool for organizing and managing your personal 3D printing projects and files.

## Getting Started
Visit the PrintVault live demo at https://printvault.vercel.app


## Features

- Comprehensive Project Management:  Create models, projects, track overall progress, add detailed descriptions, set statuses (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed"), and jot down important notes. Never lose track of those mid-project adjustments to your spaceship model – PrintVault logs it all.

- Secure & Organized File Storage: Upload STL files, G-code, reference images, and any other relevant documents directly associated with your projects. Centralize all support files for your articulated dragon print – STL, slicer settings, assembly instructions – in one place.

- Track Models Within Projects: Manage individual print jobs within larger projects. Log filament usage, print times, successes, failures, and notes specific to each print attempt. Document your journey to the perfect settings for that vase. Compare print times, materials, and notes for each version.

- Powerful Search & Filtering:  Instantly locate models or projects using keywords, tags, print status, dates, or other attributes. Need inspiration? Search 'spaceship' across all your projects to find past designs.
